          I am a 25-year-old student at CzÄ™stochowa University of Technology, and my passion is programming and application development. 
          My professional goal is to become a Fullstack Developer. I am interested in technology and various tools used in the application development process. 
          I always strive to choose the appropriate tools for each project to ensure optimal functionality and performance. 
          For example, when selecting a database for a particular application, I prioritize its suitability for the project's requirements. 
          In addition to programming, my hobbies include playing video games, which serve as a great way for me to relax and unwind.
